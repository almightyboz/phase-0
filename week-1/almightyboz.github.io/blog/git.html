      Version control allows a single person to track the iterations of their code through rewrites, seeing at each step what was added or taken away. It allows a team of people to create a central copy of a piece of code, work independently on their own versions of the code, then compare the edits/additions/subtractions among each other and against the original code.

    <p>
        Git has an automated function to time stamp commits and to mark each commit with the name of the person who made it. It also *requires* the person making the commit to write a message explaining why she chose to make her changes.

        GitHub can be accessed anywhere, site's users can group themselves into organizations for collaboration on projects. It also allows a person to specify what kind of software license they wish to use.
