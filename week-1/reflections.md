##1.1 Think About Time Reflection##

I skimmed the bunch, but delved deepest into the Pomodoro technique, flow state, and mindfulness. I have managed to graduate college and support myself because I use time boxing with the pomodoro technique. But it requires a lot of limited willpower, because I have strong emotions about what I do, and I want to do it very well.
Several recent and high-profile scientific studies show evidence that mindfulness reduces anxiety and distraction and causes the growth of the brain’s gray matter.  Mindfulness posits that we can consciously choose to view our thoughts as external and impermanent entities, and not objective reality.  But doing so means commiting to a new habit and a practice, which I think I will implement with the Fogg technique. I want to meditate for 5 minutes a day and to “check in” with my thoughts and bodily sensations once every 4 hours or so. I will make it easy by downloading a meditation app on my phone, dragging a meditation cushion to the side of my bed for a morning meditation. I will trigger it through alarms on my phone for a daily practice and a mindfulness minute, as well as practicing when I eat. Otherwise, I plan on keeping the Pomodoro technique.


##1.2 The Command Line Reflection##

1. A shell is an interface for the user to use to get to an operating system’s various functions. Bash is a unix shell (so a command-line interface) and command language. It’s gained prominence as the default shell on Linux and OS X.

2. I still have trouble understanding  shell configurations.

3. Yes.

4. man and help.

5.

> pwd - shows your current directory’s path
> ls - lists what files are in your current directory
> mv - move a file to another directory
> cd - move up and down into different directories in a “tree”
> ../ - means whatever directory is one level back in your path. In the format of a path, “/“ separates names of directories.
> touch - create new .txt files
> mkdir - makes a new empty file/directory within whatever directory I’m in
> less - pages through a text file, screen by screen
> rmdir - removes an empty directory
> rm - remove objects in directory
> help - (Windows) allows users to find information about specific commands


##1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection##

Sometimes you want to create a new blank repository that you can name and specify permissions. If you want to access an existing repository, make a copy on your GH page, and have GitHub send it to your local computer, you have to fork it. Once you have the repository’s exact URL, you click “fork” on the site. Once it’s forked, you copy the url of the forked repository. Then go to your command line, and tell your computer to use your git program to take the information in the repository and make a copy for your local machine. I honestly didn’t struggle too much with this, because I took a class on Git months ago, but the refresher was very helpful in restoring what I forgot, particularly the distinction between cloning and forking.
