##1.1 Think About Time Reflection##

I skimmed the bunch, but delved deepest into the Pomodoro technique, flow state, and mindfulness. I have managed to graduate college and support myself because I use time boxing with the pomodoro technique. But it requires a lot of limited willpower, because I have strong emotions about what I do, and I want to do it very well.
Several recent and high-profile scientific studies show evidence that mindfulness reduces anxiety and distraction and causes the growth of the brain’s gray matter.  Mindfulness posits that we can consciously choose to view our thoughts as external and impermanent entities, and not objective reality.  But doing so means commiting to a new habit and a practice, which I think I will implement with the Fogg technique. I want to meditate for 5 minutes a day and to “check in” with my thoughts and bodily sensations once every 4 hours or so. I will make it easy by downloading a meditation app on my phone, dragging a meditation cushion to the side of my bed for a morning meditation. I will trigger it through alarms on my phone for a daily practice and a mindfulness minute, as well as practicing when I eat. Otherwise, I plan on keeping the Pomodoro technique.
