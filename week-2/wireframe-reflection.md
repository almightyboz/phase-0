![Here is my blog index wireframe.](/week-2/imgs/wireframe-index.png)
A wireframe is a simplified visual mockup of a computer screen, as the user will see and interact with it. It is a tool for representing how a website's information will be communicated. A wireframe can be as little as a rough sketch of boxes that represents the desired layout, but can also be used to show interaction details. It is not a complete picture of what will be, many are greyscale and decidedly flat-looking. Wireframes are generally made and used in many stages of increased complexity. They are then changed incrementally according to specifications by clients and the rest of one's working team.
I was extremely nervous wireframing my site, and have in fact been putting off this assignment. I used [wirify](http://www.wirify.com/) for inspiration, looking through my favorite sites. (And in a moment, of weakness, googling "websites with good design" led me to [this interesting website](http://www.awwwards.com/websites/clean/).) I was ultimately inspired by the idea of an indexe in a hardcover book. Specifically, the one from a biography of Mary, Queen of Scots that I'm reading. But once I started brainstorming, I decided on an idea/gimmick for the site that I'm comfortable with, I had a lot of fun with [gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/).
