  Let’s start with version control. Version control allows developers to save code they are working on at various stages of development. That way, if mistakes are made down the line, or if one wishes to view previous work, or even look at the timeline of a project, it is easy to do. Microsoft Word achieves a similar effect via its ‘track changes’ feature, which allows one to see when changes were made, and what the text looked like prior.

 Version control allows a single person to track the iterations of their code through rewrites, seeing at each step what was added or taken away. It allows a team of people to create a central copy of a piece of code, work independently on their own versions of the code, then compare the edits/additions/subtractions among each other and against the original code.</p>

HTML5 tags I used include head, body, section, main, title, !doctype and html. Doctype and html tell the browser how to read the file and when to stop reading it, title also tells the browser what to call it. Head and body are containers for the page's metadata and references and the informational content displayed to the user, respectively. Section and main are more specific semantic elements in HTML5, they permit me to structure the information of the page based on how I want the user to interact with it.
The browser reads my code from "left to right" in a manner of speaking. The html tags on the tope and bottom are read first, then head and body concurrently, and so on and so forth until the most deeply nested element is read last. The code is expressed from the top down, so a jpeg on line 7 will propably appear closer to the top of the page than one on line 90.
I learned that Sublime can autofill chunks of boilerplate text for a document in the form of snippets. There's a snippet for a basic html page, for the lorem upsum dolor text, and so on and so forth. I think I'll probably create more snippets for my needs, automating easy tasks is a benefit of coding, and I intend on having easy tasks that I can automate at every job I do. I already know shortcuts for turning text into a comment or turning comments off. The real mind-bender for me this week was realizing that I could open a document in sublime text by typing "subl [name of file]" into the command line. (While in the same directory as the file.) And "subl ." will open every file in the directory.
