  Let’s start with version control. Version control allows developers to save code they are working on at various stages of development. That way, if mistakes are made down the line, or if one wishes to view previous work, or even look at the timeline of a project, it is easy to do. Microsoft Word achieves a similar effect via its ‘track changes’ feature, which allows one to see when changes were made, and what the text looked like prior.

 Version control allows a single person to track the iterations of their code through rewrites, seeing at each step what was added or taken away. It allows a team of people to create a central copy of a piece of code, work independently on their own versions of the code, then compare the edits/additions/subtractions among each other and against the original code.</p>
