"puts" returns nil, and then prints the outcome to the console with a line break after it.
An integer is any number that doesn't end with a decimal point, like 89 or 3. Floats end with a decimal point, e.g. 1.2, 7.9999999999 or 45.0.
Integer division is the kind we learn in school, float division rounds the output up or down (usually down) to an integer. I would explain that computers are dumb, they need two categories to understand numbers, and they cannot conceptualize that all numbers can be reprented as both integers and floats. And that all operations can change the value of the number, but the computer won't change what kind of number it is unless it's specifically told.

*How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?*

I have some experience with Ruby, so it wasn't too hard. But it did feel good to review the basics, because
