//PERSON #2  - GROUP #2

//////STORY 1
//INPUT - list of numbers
//create temporary object - set value to zero
// loop through all the numbers in the list one by one
//    add a number to the temporary object
//    return the altered temporary object for the next loop
//    continue until there are no more numbers in the list
// return the altered temporary object as the answer
//OUTPUT - one single number number

//////STORY 2
//INPUT - list of numbers
// find how many numbers are on the list - save result as a local object
//create temporary object - set value to zero
// loop through all the numbers in the list one by one
//    add the number to the temporary object
//    return the altered temporary object for the next loop
//    continue until there are no more numbers in the list
// divide the (many times altered) temporary object by the number of how many items are on the list
// output the quotient to the user
//OUTPUT - a single number

//////STORY 3
//INPUT - list of numbers
// determine how many numbers are on the list
// IF there are an odd number of numbersin the list
//    UNTIL there are only two numbers remaining in the list
//        change the list by removing the first AND last numbers from the list
//    add together the remaining two numbers
//    divide the sum by two
//    return the result to the user
// ELSE IF there are an even number of numbers in the list
//    UNTIL there is only one number remaining in the list
//        change the list by removing the first AND last numbers from the list
//    return the single remaining number on the list to the user
//OUTPUT - a single number
